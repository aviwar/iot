                        Students look for low-cost solutions that are easily available in the market, out of the
                        box
                        ready
                        to use, modular, and self-explanatory. To start learning embedded systems, the first
                        thing that
                        is
                        pretty basic and common is Arduino and Raspberry Pi. These two embedded boards are
                        feature-rich,
                        compact size with high computing power and are available with various versions and in
                        various
                        form
                        factors.

                    <p class="learning-board-para">
                        But certainly, while learning, one also needs a lot of complementary hardware that is
                        common in
                        most
                        prototype projects. For example, push-buttons, LEDs, relay, motors, display, sensors,
                        buzzers,
                        etc.

                    <p class="learning-board-para">
                        However, during the learning phase, you do not have enough exposure to decide what other
                        components
                        need to be purchased and what can be the most useful feature that we can have in our
                        project.
                        Itâ€™s
                        only after learning about the sensor that we realize how useful it can be to us in a
                        specific
                        way.

                    <p class="learning-board-para">
                        If this initial phase has fewer options to explore, then learning becomes a tedious task
                        and the
                        enthusiasm that we start with goes to waste. Only theoretical knowledge or reading about
                        sensors
                        and
                        boards cannot make a good impression as compared to getting hands-on experience while
                        creating
                        one.

                        This is where the Embedded Learner Board comes into the picture. This learning board is
                        designed
                        and
                        developed by our team it is a new board, it justifies its name because the board is
                        specifically
                        designed to improve the learning experience of the students. The board can be easily
                        connected
                        with
                        the help of jumper wires.

                        Embedded Learner Board has a lot of essential basic components designed on to the board.
                        The board can be easily mounted on another board or project with the help of a mounting
                        hole.

                        potential

                        system that not only teaches you programming and coding but also gives a hands-on
                        learning
