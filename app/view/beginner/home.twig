        <h2 class="py-3 fw-light">What is IoT?</h2>
        <p>
            IoT makes once "dumb" devices "smarter" by giving them the ability to send data over the internet,
            allowing the device to communicate with people and other IoT-enabled things.
        </p>
        <p>
            The connected "smart home" is a good example of IoT in action. Internet-enabled thermostats,
            doorbells, smoke detectors and security alarms create a connected hub where data is shared between
            physical devices and users can remotely control the "things" in that hub (i.e., adjusting
            temperature settings, unlocking doors, etc.) via a mobile app or website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Far from being restricted to just the home, the Internet of Things can be found in an array of
            devices, industries and settings. From smart blackboards in school classrooms to medical devices
            that can detect signs of Parkinson's disease, IoT is rapidly making the world smarter by connecting
            the physical and the digital.

                            In the case of IoT, the most important feature one can consider is connectivity.
                            Without
                            seamless communication among the interrelated components of the IoT ecosystems (i.e.
                            sensors, compute engines, data hubs, etc.) it is not possible to execute any proper
                            business
                            use case. IoT devices can be connected over Radio waves, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Li-Fi,
                            etc. We
                            can leverage various protocols of internet connectivity layers in order to maximize
                            efficiency and establish generic connectivity across IoT ecosystems and Industry.
                            There may
                            be special cases where the IoT ecosystem is built on-premises or in an intranet.

                            We humans can naturally understand and analyze our circumstances easily based on our
                            past
                            experiences with various things or situations. In the case of IoT in order to get
                            the best
                            of it, we need to read the analog signal, convert it in such a way that we can
                            derive
                            meaningful insights out of it. We use Electrochemical, gyroscope, pressure, light
                            sensors,
                            GPS, Electrochemical, pressure, RFID, etc. to gather data based on a particular
                            problem. For
                            example for automotive use cases, we use Light detection sensors along with
                            pressure,
                            velocity and imagery sensors. To make a use case successful we need to choose the
                            proper
                            sensing paradigm.

                            IoT device connects various products, cross-platform technologies and services work
                            together
                            by establishing an active engagement between them. In general, we use cloud
                            computing in
                            block chain to establish active engagements among IoT components. In the case of
                            Industry
                            grade, IoT solutions raw analog data need to be acquired, preprocessed and rescale
                            as per
                            business capacity. As per Google, only 50% of structured and 1% of unstructured data
                            is used
                            to make important business decisions. So while designing the IoT ecosystems carriers
                            need to
                            consider the future needs of manipulating such a huge scale of data to satisfy
                            incremental
                            business needs. One can confuse the need of active engagements with scale;
                            practically it
                            means your systems should be able to handle huge data across various technologies,
                            platforms, products, and industries.

                            IoT devices should be designed in such a way that they can be scaled up or down
                            easily on
                            demand. In general, IoT is being used from smart home automation to automating large
                            factories and work stations, so the use cases vary in scale. A carrier should design
                            their
                            IoT infrastructure depending upon their current and future engagement scale.

                            For any IoT use case, the first and foremost step is to collecting and converting
                            data in
                            such a way that means business decisions can be made out of it. In this whole
                            process,
                            various components of IoT need to change their state dynamically. For example, the
                            input of
                            a temperature sensor will vary continuously based on weather conditions, locations,
                            etc. IoT
                            devices should be designed this keeping in mind.
